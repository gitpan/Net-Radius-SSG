Net/Radius/SSG version 0.04
===========================

Net::Radius::SSG is a module for communicating with a SSG enabled Cisco router.
SSG stands for Service Selection Gateway.  This module is useful for people who
do not want to use Cisco's SSD (Service Selection Dashboard) or Cisco's SESM
(Subscriber Edge Service Manager) and would rather write their own.

The protocol used to communicate with the SSG is RADIUS.  A Merit style RADIUS
attribute dictionary that has Cisco VSA (Vendor specfic attributes) is also 
required and an example dictionary is included.  Please refer to the Net::Radius
package for more information on RADIUS dictionaries.

This package is still experimental so please email me at 
ssg@chrisandjo.com with any comments or sugguestions (or bugfixes).
